        <h2 class="h6">6. How We Provide Security and Protect Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p class="p">DocuWalk has implemented reasonable safeguards designed to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information provided or collected through our DocuWalk Services. We also adhere to several self-regulatory frameworks, including the EU-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>
        <p class="p">With respect to payment card information and other Personal Information collected through our DocuWalk Services, we use Transport Layer Security Technology or TLS to encrypt or scramble that information during transmission. We also handle all user data securely, including transmitting it using modern cryptography (for example, over HTTPS) and using blockchain technology.</p>
        <p class="p">Under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, companies must ensure certain safeguards when transferring personal data outside of the European Economic Area to countries that are not considered as offering an adequate level of protection for personal data. DocuWalk relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms to transfer personal data, including contracts with our vendors and service providers that require that they also adhere to these safeguards, and DocuWalk remains accountable for your Personal Information in cases of onward transfer to third parties.</p>
        <p class="p">Unfortunately, no system or online transmission of data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and you should always take appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Information, including ensuring that you have up-to-date antivirus software. If you believe that your DocuWalk account or any information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately through the Contact Us information provided below. Because our system is secure, you should also store your password in a safe place.</p>
        <p class="p">When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
        <h2 class="h6">7. Our Policy on Cookies, Interest-Based Advertising and “Do Not Track”</h2>
        <p class="p"><em>What Are Cookies?</em></p>
        <p class="p">Cookies are small text files placed in your computer browser directories to store your information about your use of the DocuWalk Services and your activities online (collectively, “Cookies”). A Cookie will typically contain the name of the domain (internet location) from which the Cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the Cookie (i.e. when does it expire), and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. To find out more about Cookies, including how to see what Cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
        <p class="p"><em>How We Use Cookies</em></p>
        <p class="p">We use Cookies so that we can improve your online experience – for example, by remembering you when you come back to visit us, and making the content you see more relevant to you. Cookies also enable us to track online purchases made through the DocuWalk Services.</p>
        <p class="p"><em>Your Control of Cookies</em></p>
        <p class="p">If you do not wish to receive Cookies or wish to manage when you accept Cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept our Cookies, if you set your browser to reject Cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of the DocuWalk Services. The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new Cookie, or how to disable Cookies altogether. If you block or otherwise reject our Cookies, you may lose some of the functionality of our site. For example, you may not be able to use any products and services that require you to sign in.</p>
        <p class="p"><em>Online Marketing and Advertising</em></p>
        <p class="p">The DocuWalk Services also use Cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons and clear GIF files (collectively, “Data Collection Technologies”) to help manage our online marketing and advertising program. These Data Collection Technologies are provided by our ad management partners and other third parties.</p>
        <p class="p">In addition, we and our partners may use these Data Collection Technologies to track the actions of users of the DocuWalk Services, to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, and to deliver advertisements on the DocuWalk Services that may be more relevant to individual consumers and that will improve the consumer experience on the DocuWalk Services. For example, if you give us your zip code and we thus know you live in an area where a particular promotion is going on, we may deliver to you a communication or advertisement that is specific to that promotion.</p>
        <p class="p">Please note that certain third parties that we do not control may use Data Collection Technologies on the DocuWalk Services such as information about your use of the DocuWalk Services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other legal purpose. When we use the term “Data Collection Technologies” we are referring to any technology that collects information about your use of the DocuWalk Services and potentially about your activities when you leave the DocuWalk Services and visit other sites on the Internet.</p>
        <p class="p">WHILE WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING YOU WITH MEANINGFUL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS, PLEASE BE AWARE THAT CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE OR RESPOND TO BROWSER INITIATED DO NOT TRACK (“DNT”) SIGNALS.</p>

        <h2 class="h6">9. Children’s Online Privacy</h2>
        <p class="p">DocuWalk recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of children. We will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen(13). When a user discloses personal information on the DocuWalk Services, the user is representing to us that he or she is at least thirteen (13) years of age. If a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personally identifiable information through the DocuWalk Services, we ask that a parent or guardian notify us by using the contact information on the DocuWalk website https://docuwalk.com/, and we will delete the child’s information from our records.</p>
        <h2 class="h6">10. Third Parties and Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p class="p">If you choose to use any DocuWalk Services functionality that allows you to send messages to third parties outside of the DocuWalk Services, you must obtain their permission to provide their personal information, such as their name, phone number or email address, to DocuWalk, and all other parties necessary to carry out the requested functionality, for example, by routing a message.
