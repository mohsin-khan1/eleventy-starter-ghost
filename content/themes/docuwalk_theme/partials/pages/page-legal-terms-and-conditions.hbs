        <p class="p">YOU AND SHELTERZOOM AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.</p>
        <p class="p">Any dispute between you and DocuWalk and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, “DocuWalk”) arising from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, “Covered Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) as follows:</p>
        <p class="p">Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days’ advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.<br></p>
        <p class="p">The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives, and the arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. DocuWalk and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither DocuWalk nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney general action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred. For purposes of this section, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16.</p>
        <p class="p">12.6 Governing Law &amp; Venue. These Terms will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without reference to its choice of law rules to the contrary. Customer and DocuWalk submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in New York County, New York, U.S.A.</p>
        <p class="p">12.7 Waiver. No delay or failure on the part of DocuWalk to enforce any part of these Terms will constitute a waiver of any of DocuWalk’s rights under these Terms whether for past or future actions on the part of any person. Neither the receipt of any funds by DocuWalk nor the reliance of any person on DocuWalk’s actions will be deemed to constitute a waiver of any part of these Terms. Only a specific, written waiver signed by an authorized representative of DocuWalk will have any legal effect whatsoever.</p>
        <p class="p">The waiver by either you or DocuWalk of any breach of any provision of these Terms does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to these Terms to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with these Terms will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of these Terms.</p>
        <p class="p">12.8 Severability. If any part of these Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the grant of any license to you under these Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the license will immediately terminate.</p>
        <p class="p">12.9 Taxes. You are solely responsible for any and all duties, taxes, levies or fees (including any sales, use or withholding taxes) imposed on or in connection with these Terms or the DocuWalk Services by any authority.</p>
